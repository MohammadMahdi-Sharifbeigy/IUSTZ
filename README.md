## Explanation 

### Character Classes:
 
**Human:** Represents the player character. It encompasses attributes such as HP, attack power, defense, gold, level, and XP. Players navigate the game world, engage in combat, and make decisions that influence their character's progression.
**Enemy:** Represents adversaries encountered during exploration or combat. The code includes a specific type of enemy, Zombie and Human Enemy, which engages the player in combat encounters.
 
### Game Options:
 
**Explore:** Players venture into the game world, embarking on an unpredictable journey filled with various events and encounters. These events include finding items like healing potions, stumbling upon traps, discovering treasure chests containing gold, or encountering enemies like the Zombie. Exploration adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the gameplay.

Combat continues until either the player or the enemy is defeated, adding tension and excitement to the gameplay.
**Experience and Leveling:** Defeating enemies earns players experience points (XP), contributing to their character's progression. As players accumulate XP, they may level up, gaining increased stats and potentially unlocking new abilities or equipment. Leveling up represents the player character's growth and development throughout the game.
